# Experience

## Casual research assistant | Mar/2019 – June/2020 | Deakin University

### Key Responsibilities

* Lead the development across multiple projects using React.js, Node.js, MySQL, MongoDB, Redis and Postgres databases.
* Peer-reviewed code.
* Acted as first point-of-contact for multiple clients across multiple projects.
* Dealt with various stakeholders of the projects while following Agile software development methodology.
* Helped develop standards and protocols for writing secure, maintainable code and deploying projects.

### Project: Educator Health Reporting System

Tasks carried out:

* Single-handedly developed a backend server-application using [Hapi](https://hapi.dev/) that extracts highly-sensitive participants' data securely from multiple REDCap ([project-redcap.org](https://www.project-redcap.org)) projects using its HTTP APIs, and updates a local MySQL database using [Sequelize ORM](https://sequelize.org/). Subsets of participants' data were maintained across both systems to meet various product and research requirements. Other notable node modules were utilized to fast-track the agile-development for different deployment environments, like [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) for building complex workflows, [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/) for time-sensitive as well as insensitive Behavior Driven Development, etc.
* Developed a 4NF database-design to mitigate the issues in existing systems to capture participants' data.
* Wrote a script to process ~19K records of existing data and migrate them to the new schema as well as transport them onto REDCap in batches using [Bottleneck](https://github.com/SGrondin/bottleneck).
* Implemented support for secure, multi-device sign-in using JWT authentication strategy.
* Developed frontend application using React.js and Material UI, with my primary responsibilities being functionality, navigation and routing using [react-router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/).
* Iterated multiple wireframes/designs with all stakeholders using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com:) and [Adobe XD](https://www.adobe.com/au/products/xd.html) to display the data of more than 40 variables each year on a mobile-view with UX in mind.
* Deployed the application on development and production servers using nginx, Docker, docker-compose and bash scripts.
* Modified legacy PHP reporting application to enhance security.

### Project: Overseer

Tasks carried out:

* Developed a vertically scalable, containerized ruby application that fires up host-machine Docker containers to execute and assess untrusted students' submissions on [OnTrack](https://www.deakin.edu.au/students/help/about-clouddeakin/help-guides/assessment/ontrack) system. OnTrack, previously known as *Doubtfire*, is supported by Ruby on Rails on the backend, and utilizes a Angular 8 + Angular JS frontend application.
* Added/modified various APIs as well as models for OnTrack to enable unit-chairs to configure assessments of a task as well as display results of an assessment to students and their respective faculty.
* Researched and implemented advanced security solutions provided by Docker.
* Researched and configured a RabbitMQ Docker server container to maintain job queues and support communication between the Overseer listeners as well as OnTrack.
* Developed a configurable ruby gem to implement shared code between Overseer and OnTrack for a publisher/subscriber wrapper for [Bunny](https://github.com/ruby-amqp/bunny).
* Deployed the application stack.

## Casual academic | Mar/2019 – June/2020 | Deakin University

### Key Responsibilities

* Data structures and Algorithms (Course code: SIT221, language used — C#) [2019]
* Software Architecture and Scalability for Internet-Of-Things (Course code: SIT314, languages used — JavaScript and Java) [2019]

## Software Developer Intern | Nov/2018 – Feb/2019 | Deakin University
