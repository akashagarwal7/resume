To whomsoever it may concern,

Re: <insert role title> position

I am writing to apply for the position of <insert role title> at <Company name>, which was advertised online. <Talk about your key skills and experience that would make you the best fit for the role. For example: Top notch sales skills are a must in the fast-paced world of retail and I pride myself as a very effective salesperson>

I have enclosed my CV to support my application. It shows that I would bring important skills to the position, including:
* <Experience. Include a sentence on your relevant experience. For example: I have six years’ experience working on the shop floor in two highly competitive industries>
* <Skills. Here you want to highlight some of your core skills that talk to the key selection criteria for the role. >
* <Performance. Promote a key achievement or result you’re proud of that relates to the role. For example: In my time at my current place of employment I have signed on 85 new clients and exceeded sales targets by 20% in consecutive years.>
<Talk about why you would like to work for the company and why you’d be a good fit. For example: Company name has been of interest to me since embarking on its mega store approach to retail. This is ideal for 21st century sales of flooring products. I was also impressed with the profile of your managing director Rod Smythe, which I read in the Retail journal late last year.>
I would appreciate having the opportunity to talk with you more about this position, and how I could use my skills to benefit your organization.
Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to hearing from you.
Yours sincerely,
Akash Agarwal
