G'day,

[//1]: # (This may be the most platform independent comment. Different content in different branches to meet different needs START)

Top-notch problem-solving skills are a must in the fast-paced and complex world of IT and pride myself as an excellent solutions architect. I have a knack for consistency, and I thrive by investing my time in learning/building useful tools to benefit the world, the people I work with and myself.

My [resume](https://akashagarwal7.com/about/main/resume/) shows that I would bring important skills to a potential role, including:

[//2]: # (Different content in different branches to meet different needs END)

* I have more than 16 years of experience in using computers and programming and more than 8 years as a software engineer, working across multiple programming languages and development frameworks while serving the requirements of clients from various backgrounds.
* During my time at the Applied Artificial Intelligence Institute, I've gained extensive experience in the intricacies of dealing with Large Language Models, Google Cloud, Azure and AWS, while continuing gaining significant experience in full-stack development. I've also learnt how to put people first, both stakeholders and end-users. My curoisty and a keen eye for detail enabled me to help my organisation in tackling multiple challenges over the course of my employment.
* During my time tutoring at Deakin University, I have also gained valuable tutoring experience for OOP concepts, Data Structures and Algorithms, as well as Software architecture and scalability for IoT using AWS, IBM Cloud and other cloud-based solutions.
* I am skilled in *nix systems as well as using popular tools for automation, orchestration and containerizing services using Kubernetes, Docker, CI/CD and DevOps, with a knack for security and always thriving to do the right thing.
* I can quickly pick up new skills, build prototypes, research, and understand various documentation types like web APIs, source-code and documentations (like Java docs), man pages, RFCs, etc. This enables me to build robust solutions and efficiently connect tools/services to solutions or use them as a part of a workflow.

I consider myself to be a good fit for team environments because I believe in communication being a major driver for the success of a project/undertaking. I highly believe in maintaining cohesion through establishing centralized knowledge bases to reduce friction and thus enabling higher autonomy across teams.

An opportunity to talk to you more about a potential role and how I could use my skills to benefit your organization would be much appreciated.

Thank you for reading.\

Yours sincerely,\
Akash Agarwal
