G'day,

[//1]: # (This may be the most platform independent comment. Different content in different branches to meet different needs START)

Top-notch problem-solving skills are a must in the fast-paced and complex world of IT and pride myself as an excellent solutions architect. I have a knack for consistency, and I am always thriving to invest my time in learning useful things to reap the benefits in the long run.

My [resume](../resume) shows that I would bring important skills to a potential role, including:

[//2]: # (Different content in different branches to meet different needs END)

* I have more than 12 years of experience as a programmer and 4 years as a software engineer, working across multiple programming languages and development frameworks while serving the requirements of clients from various backgrounds.
* During my time at Deakin University, I have also gained valuable tutoring experience for OOP concepts, Data Structures and Algorithms, as well as Software architecture and scalability for IoT using AWS, IBM Cloud and other cloud-based solutions.
* I am skilled in *nix systems as well as using popular tools for automation, orchestration and containerizing services using Kubernetes, Docker, CI/CD and DevOps, with a knack for security and always thriving to do the right thing.
* I can quickly pick up new skills, build prototypes, research, and understand various documentation types like web APIs, source-code and documentations (like Java docs), man pages, RFCs, etc. This enables me to build robust solutions and efficiently connect tools/services to solutions or use them as a part of a workflow.

I consider myself to be a good fit for team environments because I believe in communication being a major driver for the success of a project/undertaking. I highly believe in maintaining centralized documentation to avoid a lot of to and fro communication and enabling higher independence across teams.

An opportunity to talk to you more about a potential role and how I could use my skills to benefit your organization would be much appreciated.

Thank you for reading.
